# Monetization & Ethics (stance)

CoordCard is designed to be **open, inspectable, and sovereignty-respecting**.

This project’s guiding stance is simple:

- **The protocol stays open.**
- **Monetization (if any) lives at the implementation/support layer.**

This is not a promise about future pricing; it’s a boundary intended to keep the work coherent under success.

## Principles

### 1) Keep the protocol open and boring

If CoordCard generates revenue, the first use of that value should be to keep the spec:

- stable and additive,
- well-documented,
- easy to validate,
- resistant to “lock-in by ambiguity.”

The work that makes standards real is often unglamorous: maintenance, examples, interop tests, and careful wording.

### 2) Ethical monetization: implementation + support

Acceptable monetization vectors are things like:

- reference implementations and adapters,
- enterprise support and training,
- security review and hardening of implementations,
- hosted services **only when explicitly opt-in**,
- paid integrations and customization.

### 3) No telemetry by default

CoordCard should not depend on surveillance to function.

- **No telemetry assumed** by the protocol.
- If an implementation offers diagnostics, it should be explicit, minimal, and opt-in.

### 4) Fund real-world testing

If there is budget, prioritize:

- reproducible test harnesses,
- safe sandbox environments,
- bounties for integrations,
- security review.

### 5) Support sovereignty-respecting ecosystems

When possible, direct value toward projects and contributors that:

- reduce coercion,
- increase interoperability,
- demonstrate high-signal stewardship.

## Summary

CoordCard aims to be the kind of coordination artifact that can be trusted by diverse agents:

- **open spec first**,
- revenue from **implementation/support**,
- **no surveillance** as a business model,
- keep boundaries clear so the project doesn’t drift into an enforcement framework.
